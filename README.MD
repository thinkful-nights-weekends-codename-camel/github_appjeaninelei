# GitHub API Jeanine and Lei

to display a list of repos belonging to a particular GitHub handle.

Review GitHub's API documentation for the list user repositories endpoint to understand how this endpoint works.
Create an app and push it to GitHub.
When you're done, submit the link to your GitHub repo at the bottom of the page.
Requirements:
The user must be able to search for a GitHub user handle.
The search must trigger a call to GitHub's API.
The repos associated with that handle must be displayed on the page.
You must display the repo name and link to the repo URL.
The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.
This exercise should take about an hour to complete. If you're having trouble, attend a Q&A session or reach out on Slack for help.
